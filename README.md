# piggy-bank

A java application, used as backend for the piggy-bank-frontend app.
Since this is a simple test application, i'd prefer to not use a database. A simple CSV it's working great for now.

To work with the application, choose your preferred ide and import project as "gradle project".

To run the code directly from command line:
* open a terminal and move into the directory where you have checked out.
* Run "./gradlew clean build bootRun" to run the application
